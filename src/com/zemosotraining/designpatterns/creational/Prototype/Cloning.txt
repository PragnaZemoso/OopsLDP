Clone: “create a copy of object”

Different ways for creating copy object:
Shallow, deep

SHALLOW COPY:
Whenever we use default implementation of clone method we get shallow copy of object
It means it creates a new instance and copies all the fields of the object to that new instance where
both are referencing to the same memory in heap memory.

DEEP COPY:
process of creating exactly the independent duplicate objects in the heap memory and
manually assigning the values of the second object where values are supposed to be copied is called deep cloning.
