Fluent interface: a fluent interface is an object-oriented API whose design relies extensively on method chaining.

There are two specific problems that we need to solve:

1. Too many constructor arguments.
     Adding more constructor parameters results in code that becomes harder to read.
     If we had 10 different parameters, it would become very difficult to identify what's what in the constructor at a single glance.
     To make it worse, some of those values might be optional, which means that we'll need to create a bunch of overloaded constructors to deal with all possible combinations, or we'll have to pass nulls to our constructor (ugly!).
2. Incorrect object state.
